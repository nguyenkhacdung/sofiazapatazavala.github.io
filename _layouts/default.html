  Hi! Thanks for pressing Ctrl+U.

  Take a look at this code. This is my first Jekyll theme, and it's also using cutting-edge technology. I'm currently using a version of Bootstrap 4 compiled from the Sass files, and I'll be adding new HTML+CSS+JS technologies as I learn & practice with them.

  For any other questions, please email me: hola [at] szz [dot] cl.
