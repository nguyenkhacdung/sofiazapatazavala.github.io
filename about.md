### I'm a State-of-the-art trans gal.
#### As simple as that.

Oh, hey.

In case you were wondering, my name is Sofía. I'm a transgender woman who currently lives in Santiago, Chile. I'm 28, and I have a major in Biology, although I also work as a Full-Stack Developer and enjoy with photography, fashion and politics. As you can see, all of these different interests blend into creating the kind of person that I am.

Since these pieces of text may not be enough for you, you can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/szapatazavala) & [Instagram](https://instagram.com/sofiazapatazavala) to know me better. And if you need to e-mail me or something, you can always find me on *hola [at] szz [dot] cl*.

Welcome!

#### S.
